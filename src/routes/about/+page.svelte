    <p class="py-1">
      I am a high school student from Indianapolis, IN who is currently studying to become a software engineer, although 
      I may switch majors to Agricutlure. I am currently employed part time for U-Haul as a Reservation Manager and at my company 
      H2 Technologies as the COO. My end goal is to end up living in rural Indiana, preferably in the southern part of the state,
      doing running a farming operation of my own that I may pass down my family.

    <p class="py-1">
      I have been programming for about {new Date().getFullYear() - new Date(2020, 1).getFullYear()} years now, with my first language 
      being python, mainly to automate tasks or mess around with friends. In 2021, I learned JavaScript and in 2023, I learned TypeScript 
      and Svelte. My main stack currently is SvelteKit for frontend work and typescript for backend work or any Node.js project. I have 
      also used Tauri for a few projects, mainly since it's easy to create a UI with it. I am not super experienced with rust or go yet.
      I have used Java for my AP Computer Science class, but I'd much rather use C# since it's more modern and easier to use.

      Outside of school and programming, I like to play video games <i>(Which I used post on YouTube found on my <a href="/socials">socials</a> 
      page)</i>, take pictures, and do <i><a href="/vatsim" class="text-emerald-500">Virtual Air Traffic Controlling</a></i>. I also have found an interest in 
      horseback riding, although I don't do it as much as I would like to. I also love listening to music and driving around town with my windows
      down (weather permitting).
